1. Is the server running asyncronouly?
=> Node server runs asynchronously.
   When we request same server via multiple browsers, each clients are served asynchronously
   without waiting for the first to respond.



2. Result of using process.nextTick
=> When we use nextTick, all the process in nextTick stack should be cleared to start next event loop
   and all IO processes are also blocked until nextTick is finished.
   But setImmediate, recursion uses separate event loop so does not block next event loop.
